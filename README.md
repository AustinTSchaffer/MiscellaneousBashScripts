# Miscellaneous Bash Scripts

Miscellaneous, self-contained bash scripts that I've come up with to help solve miscellaneous issues. Feel free to use them or create an issue if you have any questions.

Oh, and please be sure that you understand what the scripts are doing before running them.
Search the scripts for `mv` and `cp` and `rm` and `sudo` and `curl` and other potentially dangerous
commands before running.

I am not liable for damages.

## Compare.sh

This script compares the contents of a repo with the contents of a copy of the repo. This
is to help find which commit in the repo matches the copy of the repo, when the copy of
the repo doesn't have history information.
